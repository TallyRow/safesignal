# Specification Quality Checklist: React, Caught — `./framework-react` Error Boundary + `useLogError()`

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- **Content Quality nuance**: This is a package whose stated scope *is* a React adapter, so "React"
  and the `<LogErrorBoundary>`/`useLogError()` names appear in the spec as the named public contract
  from issue #17 — not as implementation leakage. The spec deliberately defers concrete API shape
  (props, hook signature, logger provisioning, supported React range, source-marker representation)
  to `/speckit-plan`, keeping requirements behavior-focused.
- All ambiguities were resolved with documented reasonable defaults (see Assumptions); zero
  `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers were required.
